This dataset contains records of student admissions, including demographic information, academic performance, and admission statuses. It provides a foundation for analyzing factors influencing student admissions and identifying patterns or anomalies in the data.
This dataset can be used for:
Data Cleaning Exercises: Handling missing values, outliers, and invalid entries.
Admission Analysis: Identifying key factors influencing admissions.
Pattern Recognition: Detecting trends and anomalies in student performance and demographics.
Recommendations for Cleaning:
Replace missing values with appropriate imputation strategies (e.g., mean, median, or mode).
Remove or correct invalid entries (e.g., Age of -1, High School Percentage of -10).
Normalize and validate numerical fields (e.g., ensure Admission Test Score lies within a valid range).
Review inconsistent gender assignments and missing names for accuracy.
